## Start
Before the game starts the player needs to create a character.

You can also influence stats during character creation, which will change a bit,
but not as much as race will influence them.
After choosing stats, the player will be able to choose a few skills.
After that the player will be placed inside an arena, and will be able to choose from a number of weapons,
