# Mamalian
Mamalian is an isometric aRPG where your goal is to beat as many enemies as you possible can.

# Gameplay
## Start
Before the game starts the player needs to create a character.  
During the character creation the player can choose between race, or animals rather, 
who all have different stats.  
You can also influence stats during character creation, which will change a bit, but not as much as races will.  
After choosing stats, the player needs to select a class, which will give the player a few skills.
After that the player will be placed inside an arena, and will be able to choose from a number of weapons, and armour.
When the player is done with that, the waves of enemies will start flowing in, trying to kill the user.

After every wave the player is presented with 3 powerups, of which the player can choose one.

# Building
##Requirements
Before you can start to build you need the following software installed:
- Visual Studio 
- MonoGame 3.5  
 
Once you've done that simply clone this repository in Visual Studio 2015 using the "Open From Source Control..." option.
After that simply build the project by going to Build > Build Solution.  
If this generates any errors you probably installed MonoGame wrong, or a wrong version of it.

If this didn't generate any errors you have succesfully builded the project.
